		   <h1>Ah, February. </h1>
		</div>
		<div>
		  <p>The holidays will be over, summer conference season will still be far off, and, chances are, you'll be trapped at home by ice or snow.</p>
		  <p>Why not make some hot chocolate, fire up your laptop, and hang out virtually with a bunch of people who geek out about JavaScript and hardware just as much as you?</p>
		  <h1>Introducing the first JavaScript on Things CozyConf, a winter remote conference.</h1>
		  <ul>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>Who:</b> People from all over the world who are working on bringing JavaScript to the Internet of Things, whether with johnny-five, Espruino, Kinoma, or something else.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>What:</b> A chance to get a "state of the union" on JSoT endeavors, learn new tricks, and attend some neat workshops for a variety of skill levels.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>Where:</b> The comfort of your own home or coffee shop (you can even wear your PJs if you want to). You could also get a group together to stream it in one place.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>When:</b> February 2017, exact date(s) coming soon.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>Why:</b> Because the JSoT community is still small enough for something like this to work. And because traveling with hardware demos can be a pain and requires time away from work and family.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-arrow_right"></i> <b>Cost:</b> To be determined, but the goal is to make this accessible to a wide variety of people. Also, in the spirit of groups like <a href="http://donutjs.club" target="_blank">DonutJS</a>, I'd like to donate everything after expenses to a non-profit promoting diversity and inclusiveness in tech.</li>
		  </ul>
		</div>

		  <h1>We need your help!</h1>
		  <p>Since this is the first time this is happening, we need lots of help, such as:</p>
		  <ul>
		      <li><i class="em em-clipboard"></i> <b>Planning:</b> If you've got event planning experience, especially with remote events, get in here.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-moneybag"></i> <b>Sponsors:</b> We'll need sponsors to help us pay for things like bandwidth, hosting, and more.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-art"></i> <b>Design Skills for Conference Site and Identity:</b> We could use a talented artist or two to help make things look snazzy.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-movie_camera"></i> <b>Logistics & Technology:</b> Streaming video, audio, and chat for the event itself.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-microphone"></i> <b>Speakers & Workshops:</b> A CFP will be announced soon! We'll need lecture/keynote style updates on major endeavors and workshops across skill levels.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-yellow_heart"></i> <b>Inclusivity & Accessibility:</b> Even though this is a remote conference, we want to strive to make it accessible to as many people as possible. If you're an expert at that, please jump in.</li>
		      <li><i class="em em-sparkles"></i> <b>Pizzazz:</b> Just because it's remote doesn't mean it can't be awesome. Events like XOXO, Cascadia, and DinosaurJS have really raised the bar. Let's do something creative to get folks excited.</li>
		  </ul>
